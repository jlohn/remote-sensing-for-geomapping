# RS GeoMapping
Open source project for using remote sensing data to aid in geologic mapping.

This repo started as I was exploring and learning how to use Landsat data in geoscience applications. 
It's currently a collection of datasets and tools I've written or found useful for processing public domain 
imagery, primarily Landsat and Sentinel. 

Some of the things I'm interested in working and collaborating on:

- producing geologic maps for areas that are already groundtruthed
- interfaces to public domain spectral signature databases (USGS, Canadian)
- interfaces to other geoscience databases such as assessments, drilling data
- computer vision algorithms for identifying geologic features (eg bedrock)
- automatically generating geologic maps from Landsat and Sentinel data
- tutorial for high school and undergraduate students to learn about remote sensing in geology applications

It's a part-time project but welcome others contributing to it, especially geologists.

In the future I plan to package up the most useful tools into a QGIS plugin.
